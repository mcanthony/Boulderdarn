### v4: Ready for testing

## Bugs

- When player moves they sometimes "eat" moving blocks
- Falling blocks should crush bad guys
- Exploded diamonds remove from count?
- Should be able to "push" rocks


## FIX Ω for EJECTA, YO!

- fix urlparams (check window, window.location)
- remove doc.queryselector
- remove setAttribute (or add to ejecta)
- fire onload - Ω.pageLoad();
- auto use "canvas" object
